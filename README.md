## Air Quality and Fireworks in Berlin Viz

Repo with code to extract and process data to visualize air quality metrics and how these
are impacted during new years eve fireworks. 

### PLAN:
- import data via wrapper around openweather api 
- viz using ggplot2

Well, the data does not show any apparent effect of fireworks on air quality. 
Maybe with more granular data, it would show more sensitivity? 

Good to learn how to interface with openweather api !
