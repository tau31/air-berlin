Following the report form IQAir, stating that ["only 7 countries world wide meet WHO dirty air guidelines"](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/11/only-seven-countries-worldwide-meet-who-dirty-air-guidelines-study-shows),
I wanted to analyze these metrics for the city of Berlin, particularly the concentration of toxic PM<sub>2.5<\sub> particles.
