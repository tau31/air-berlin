# The WHO air quality guideline (AQG) states that annual average concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 Âµg/m3, while 24-hour average exposures should not exceed 15 Âµg/m3 more than 3 - 4 days per year.

# Interim targets have been set to support the planning of incremental milestones toward cleaner air, particularly for cities, regions and countries that are struggling with high air pollution levels. For PM2.5 these are:

#     35 Âµg/m3 annual mean, 75 Âµg/m3 24-hour mean.
#     25 Âµg/m3 annual mean, 50 Âµg/m3 24-hour mean.
#     15 Âµg/m3 annual mean, 37.5 Âµg/m3 24-hour mean.
#     10 Âµg/m3 annual mean, 25 Âµg/m3 24-hour mean.
